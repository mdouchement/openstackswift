# OpenStackSwift

**Only for development and test purpose.**

OpenStackSwift is a Golang server that responds to the same calls Openstack Swift responds to. It's a convenient way to use Swift out-of-the-box without any fancy dependencies and configuration. It aims to be **portable** and **lightweight**.

OpenStackSwift doesn't support all of the Swift command set, but the basic ones like upload (with TTL), download, list, copy, authentication, and make containers are supported. More coming soonâ„¢.
